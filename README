# Data Health Dashboard

A lightweight data-quality checker built in Python.  
It loads a CSV file, runs a series of data health checks, prints a summary, and saves a JSON report.

---

## 🚀 Features (Phase 1 Complete)

### ✔ CSV Loading  
Automatically detects comma-separated or tab-separated files.

### ✔ Data Health Checks  
Currently includes:
- **Missing values**
- **Duplicate rows**

### ✔ JSON Reporting  
Every run generates a timestamped JSON file stored in the `reports/` folder.

### ✔ CLI Tool  
Run the program from the command line with:

```bash
python main.py yourfile.csv
```

## ▶️ Usage

Run the tool on any CSV:

## 🛠 Future Phases

### **Phase 2 – SQLite Database Storage**  
Save each run + each check into a local database for history tracking.

### **Phase 3 – REST API (FastAPI)**  
Expose endpoints like:
- `POST /analyze`
- `GET /runs`
- `GET /runs/{id}`

### **Phase 4 – Web Dashboard**  
A simple UI to browse past runs and visualize data health results.

### **Phase 5 – Docker + Deployment**  
Containerize the app and deploy to the cloud.
